openGUI
=======

Processing 1.5+ open-source GUI library. It should also work on processingjs and may work with old releases of Processig such as 1.0, but it's not sure. 

Important :
If you use textbox in your application, you must add to your main code (code with name same as the name of the project) following lines, where textboxobj is your textbox object :
void keyReleased(){
textboxobj.keyReleased();
}

Examples :
Look in examples folder, and you will see how to use openGUI.
