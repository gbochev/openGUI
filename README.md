openGUI
=======

Processing 1.5+ open-source GUI library. It should also work on processingjs and may work with old releases of Processig such as 1.0, but it's not sure. 

How to use it :
Open new tab in your Processing project and put all the code from openGUI.pde and save it. That's it.

Important :
If you use textbox in your application, you must add to your main code (with name same as the name of your project) following lines, where textboxobj is your textbox object :

void keyReleased(){

textboxobj.keyReleased();

}

Examples :
Look in examples folder to see how to use openGUI.
